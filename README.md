Clinical AI Safety Evaluation

Overview
This project evaluates large language model reliability in high-stakes clinical decision-support scenarios. The focus is on hallucination detection, reasoning consistency, adversarial robustness, and uncertainty calibration in medical prompts.

Research Objectives
Measure hallucination frequency in diagnostic and pharmacologic prompts
Evaluate response consistency under paraphrased inputs
Stress-test models with adversarial or misleading clinical information
Analyze uncertainty expression in ambiguous medical cases
Why This Matters
Large language models are increasingly used in healthcare-adjacent contexts. In low-resource settings, overreliance on incorrect outputs can lead to amplified clinical risk. This project aims to build a lightweight evaluation framework for safer deployment.

Methodology
The framework:
Runs structured prompt test suites
Logs outputs across multiple iterations
Compares response variance
Flags unsafe or fabricated claims

Future Directions
Integration with benchmark datasets
Quantitative hallucination scoring
Cross-model alignment comparison
Publication of reproducible evaluation metrics
